**ScriptTester**

Run tests on scripts for BRUTE with public input/output file pairs.
The software is designed for scripts in Java,Python, C++ and C.
It supports .in ,.out files(also .txt but there maybe some timing issues)

*How to start with it :3*

I.   Clone the repository

II.  Install requirements.txt - *pip install -r requirements.txt*

III. Navigate to the testing directory

IV.  Use command *python main.py path/to/the/script path/to/the/testing/directory*
(if you are using different linking paths to python, you need to use python3)

V.   If you want to see the whole output use -f at the end of the command

If you did everything correctly the output should look like this:

pub01.in - Test Passed! Time: 0.0145s
-------
pub02.in - Test Passed! Time: 0.0124s
-------
pub03.in - Test Passed! Time: 0.0139s
-------
pub04.in - Test Passed! Time: 0.0139s
-------
pub05.in - Test Passed! Time: 0.0129s
